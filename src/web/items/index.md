# What are items?

In Aquarium items are the entity you can create to represent your project's data. An item can be a [Project](/web/items/project), a [Task](/web/items/task), a [User](/web/items/user), an [Asset](/web/items/asset), etc.

<$>[note]
By convention, the type of an item always starts with a capital letter.
