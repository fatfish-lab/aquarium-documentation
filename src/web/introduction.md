# How Aquarium works

When you work with people, not everyone has the same needs. Some people need to focus on their work, others need to manage their project, and some need to review the work.

That's why Aquarium offer 3 different interfaces :

| [Focus](/web/interfaces/focus) | [Studio](/web/interfaces/studio) | [Rooms](/web/interfaces/rooms) |
|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| [![Focus](/_medias/focus.png)](/web/interfaces/focus) | [![Studio](/_medias/studio.png)](/web/interfaces/studio) | [![Rooms](/_medias/rooms.png)](/web/interfaces/rooms) |
| [Focus](/web/interfaces/focus), is the easy interface. It's a unique experience, where you can focus on your work. Users also have access to their diary, with all their tasks and timelogs. | [Studio](/web/interfaces/studio) is the complete interface. It's working like on your computer, where you can create folders and choose how to display its content by creating workspaces. | [Rooms](/web/interfaces/rooms) is the interface dedicated for external reviews. No need to give them access to the full project, only share some playlists and read-only workspaces. |
