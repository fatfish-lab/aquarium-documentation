# Rooms interface

The rooms interface is the interface for external reviews. It's a simple interface that allows you to see all playlists and overviews that are shared with you.

> [!info]
> An account is required to access to this interface. This allows us to display the name of the person who comments, secure the access to the medias and check user permissions.

Playlist and workspaces are regrouped into [room](../items/room.md). You can crate a room for a department or directly for a project. Use them as you want.

Once you selected a room, you can see all the playlists and workspaces that they contain.
