From this application, you can see all the notifications that you have received. You can also mark them as read or unread.

You can save a notification by clicking on the <span class="aq-icon">bookmark</span> icon.

You can add tags on your notifications to regroup them together and categorize them. For that just drag and drop a notification on an existing tag or on `drop to add a tag`.

Notifications are sent using the [action](../items/action.md) system.
Check our [how-to guide to setup your own notifications](../../how-to/setup/notifications.md).
