## Console (the nodal explorer)

The console is a powerful tool that allows you to explore the content of your Aquarium in a nodal way.

![Console](../../_medias/screenshots/command-console.webp)

- **Browse**: From the console you can browse your items using a nodal interface. Click on the <span class="aq-icon outline">flag</span> icon to use this item as the starting point of the query.
  1. You can also enter the _key of the item by clicking on the button.

2. **View item/edge data**: By clicking on an item, you can see its data and metadata using the right panel. You can also do the same by selecting an edge.
- **Custom query**: At the bottom you can change and write your own meshQL query to filter the items.
