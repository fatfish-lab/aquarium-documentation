## Console (the nodal explorer)

The console is a powerful tool that allows you to explore the content of your Aquarium in a nodal way.

![Console](../../_medias/screenshots/command-console.webp)

- **Browse**: From the console you can browse your items using a nodal interface. Click on the <span class="aq-icon outline">flag</span> icon to use this item as the starting point of the query.
  1. You can also enter the _key of the item by clicking on the button.

2. **View item/edge data**: By clicking on an item, you can see its data and metadata using the right panel. You can also do the same by selecting an edge.
3. **Enable edition**: By default the console is in read-only mode. You can enable the edition by toggling the switch on the top right corner.
   - When edition is enabled you can create new connection between items by dragging from "New edge" entry onto the target item. Once the dropping is done, a dialog wheel appear so you can select the edge type you want. Use the `Other...` to create a custom edge type.
   - In the right panel, a new button appears to trash an item or delete an edge.
