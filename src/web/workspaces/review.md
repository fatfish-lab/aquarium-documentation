1. **List of item**: Using the standard filter and column system, you can choose which items and columns you want to display. Only items where we can detect a media are selectable.
2. **Playlist**: All selected items will be displayed there. By default we will load the latest uploaded media of each item. You can change the media version by clicking on the media from the timeline at the bottom.
3. **Save**: You can save your review to freeze it's content. You can save it:
   1. **As a playlist**: This will save the review in a playlist.
   2. **In a room**: [Rooms](../applications/rooms.md) are our system in place to share data with external users with out giving them access to the all project.
   3. **To Syncsketch**: You can publish your review to Syncsketch. Checkout more in our [integration guide](../../integrations/syncsketch.md).
