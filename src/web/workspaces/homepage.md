# Homepage

This workspace is a special workspace, provided by default in the [Aquarium Studio interface](../_interfaces/studio.md), at the root of a [Project](../items/project.md), an [Organisation](../items/organisation.md) or your [User](../items/user.md).

1. **Settings**: You can open the settings of the project, organisation or user directly from here.
2. **Assistants & Shortcuts**: Assistants are here to help you to configure your project (like setup your Asset & Shots). Once an assistant is completed, it will be replaced by a shortcut for a quick access. You can also create your own shortcuts, using the `Settings`.
3. **Wiki**: You can access to the main Wiki of your project directly from the homepage.
4. **Milestones & people**: You can see the milestones of your project and the people involved in it.
5. **Set as default**: This workspace is enabled by default, unless another workspace is created. If you prefer to keep that workspace as your default one, you can click on the `Set as default` in the <span class="aq-icon">more_vert</span> icon.
