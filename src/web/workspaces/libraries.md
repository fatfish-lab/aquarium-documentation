# Assets manager

This workspace is dedicated to the management of your assets. It is the place where you will create, edit, and delete your assets.

You can regroup assets into [Library](../items/library.md) to regroup them by type.
> Example: character, props, environment, etc.

1. **Create**: Click on this button to create a new [Library](../items/library.md) or a new [Asset](../items/asset.md). You can also access [import a CSV file](../../how-to/setup/assets.md) to create [episodes](../items/episode.md), [libraries](../items/library.md), [assets](../items/asset.md) and [tasks](../items/task.md) in bulk.
2. **Add column**: Choose the columns you want to enable in your workspace. Those columns are based on our presets. But if you want to create a custom column, follow our [guide](../../../how-to/create/column.md).
