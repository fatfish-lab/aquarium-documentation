# Todolist

This workspace is dedicated to the management of a list of tasks, like a backlog of tasks.

![Todolist](/_medias/screenshots/todolist.webp)

It's a pretty straightforward workspace. You can create, edit, and delete tasks. Click on a task to visualize all it's details.

Expand a task to see all it's sub-tasks and create new ones.
