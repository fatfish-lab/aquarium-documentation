Like we explained in the [introduction](/web/introduction), the workspaces are like the Explorer on Windows, or the Finder on macOS: **they are dedicated to display your project's data.**

Workspaces works the same way in the focus or studio interface. The only difference is the way you access them.

| In [focus interface](/web/interfaces/focus) | In [studio interface](/web/interfaces/studio) |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| ![Focus workspaces](/_medias/focus-workspaces.png) | ![Studio workspaces](/_medias/studio-workspaces.png) |
| Workspaces are regrouped by need (assets manager, shots manager, ...) | Workspaces are regrouped by location. You need to go the the correct folder to be able to active the workspace you want. |

We created several workspaces, to fit specific project management needs.
