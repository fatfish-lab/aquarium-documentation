# Manager
Dear manager, welcome on Aquarium. We are happy to have you here.

Our first video is your perfect guide to create a new project within Aquarium. Weâ€™re putting the spotlight on project presets, assets, sequences and shots creations. You will learn how to create multiple workspaces, allowing you to customize your project to create departments overviews for example.

Permissions and security are also an important part of you project. We will show you how to create usergroups and assign permissions to them. This way, you can manage who has access to what in your project. We also show you how to edit your project's statuses and customize them to fit your needs.
