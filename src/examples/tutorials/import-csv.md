# How to import a CSV file to create episodes, sequences and shots ?

Need to move your existing project data from an Excel or Google Spreadsheet into a new Aquarium project? This tutorial is for you!

Learn the fast, efficient way to import a CSV file into Aquarium.
We'll show you step-by-step how to take your external data including shot names, frame counts, and task statuses and seamlessly integrate it into a new, organized project.


## 💡 What you'll learn in this video:

- Create a new project using the VFX preset as an example.
- Import your CSV file using the shots manager after your project is created.
- Assign columns to the correct Aquarium elements (shots, properties, and task statuses). We show how to map columns for the shot name, frame count, information, and various task statuses.
- Define task statuses by customizing colors and setting completion percentages (e.g., done at 100%, work in progress at 15%).
- View your completed project with all your shots created and the completion column automatically updated based on the defined statuses.
- Add columns to display your imported shot properties (like frame and information).
